ReadMeRos_data

The file "RoskildeAdeligeJomfruKloster-1699-1749-table-txt (1)" is the full table including comments and sources.

ExcelRosTableNoComments is the same with comments and sources removed. 
RosTableNoComments.csv is the same file exported, and the one I started to work with in RStudio. 

RosTableAge is the final dataset, including mutated columns, from which most plots were made. 
RosTableAge2 is an alternate version of the same dataset.
