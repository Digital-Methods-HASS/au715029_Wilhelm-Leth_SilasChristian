The map and timeline were created by me in December 2023, using a plethora of online sources, loosely listed in the documents list of further reading. All sources for the map and timeline were retrieved in december 2023, and eventual changes since thenm as well as earlier versions of these websites, will not be reflected on map nor timeline.
The images were created using photoshop. All parts of both are original work, no other maps, stock images or color schemes were appropriated.
